// Complexity Analysis:
// Time Complexity: O(m + n) - The algorithm iterates through both the magazine and the ransomNote, where 'm' is the length of the magazine and 'n' is the length of the ransomNote.
// Space Complexity: O(m) - The space used is proportional to the number of unique characters in the magazine.

// Possible Optimization:
// The code is already efficient and has a linear time complexity of O(m + n). The use of a map simplifies the tracking of character frequencies. No further optimization is required.
